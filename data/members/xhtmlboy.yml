bio:
  I am passionate about computer development and this site/blog will serve as a space to
  document my attempts to become a Java Champion or Google Developer Expert. Apart from
  software design and (valid) XHTML, I have a particular passion for everything related to
  the concept of muscles. I love muscular people.
